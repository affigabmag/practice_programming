  Summary:
  - You've completed Exercise 7 (Functions) with all 5 tasks working
  correctly:
    - ✓ greet() function
    - ✓ add() function
    - ✓ multiply() function
    - ✓ getLength() function
    - ✓ isEven() function
  - Exercise 8 (Loops) has been created for you with 5 tasks to practice:
    a. For loop that prints numbers 1 to 5
    b. For loop that prints numbers 10 down to 1 (reverse)
    c. While loop (1 to 3)
    d. For loop (iterate through string characters)
    e. For loop (sum array elements)

  Let me know when you're ready to start working on Exercise 8 or if you
  need any clarification!

> show example of loop for task 1 ex08 

● Here's an example of a for loop for Task 1:

  // Task 1: Create a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5

  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      console.log(i);
  }

  // Output:
  // 1
  // 2
  // 3
  // 4
  // 5

  Breaking it down:
  - let i = 1 - Start at 1
  - i <= 5 - Continue while i is less than or equal to 5
  - i++ - Add 1 to i after each loop
  - console.log(i) - Print the current number

  The structure:
  for (initialization; condition; increment) {
      // code to repeat
  }

  Try it out! Copy this into your ex08_loops.js file for Task 1.

> why task 2 fails 

● I need to see what you wrote for Task 2. Let me read the file to check:

● Read(node.js\ex08_loops.js)
  ⎿  Read 31 lines

● I found the issue! On line 12, your condition is wrong:

  for (let c=10;c<=1;c--)  // ❌ Wrong!

  The problem is c<=1 - this means "while c is less than or equal to 1".
  Since c starts at 10, this condition is false from the start, so the loop
  never runs!

  Fix it to:
  for (let c=10;c>=1;c--)  // ✓ Correct!
  {
      console.log(c);
  }

  Why this works:
  - Start at 10: c=10
  - Continue while c >= 1 (greater than or equal to 1)
  - Decrement by 1 each time: c--
  - This prints: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

  Change <= to >= and it will work!

> clarify better task 5 

● Let me read the file again to see Task 5:

● Read(node.js\ex08_loops.js)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines

● Here's a detailed breakdown of Task 5:

  The Goal:
  - You have an array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  - Loop through each number
  - Add them all up (1+2+3+4+5 = 15)
  - Print the final total

  Step-by-step example:

  // Task 5: Create a for loop that adds up numbers in an array and prints 
  the total
  // Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  let total = 0;  // Start with 0

  // Loop through each element
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      total = total + array[i];  // Add current number to total
      console.log("Adding " + array[i] + ", total is now " + total);
  }

  console.log("Final total: " + total);

  Output:
  Adding 1, total is now 1
  Adding 2, total is now 3
  Adding 3, total is now 6
  Adding 4, total is now 10
  Adding 5, total is now 15
  Final total: 15

  Key points:
  - let total = 0 - Create a variable to store the sum
  - array[i] - Access each number in the array
  - total = total + array[i] - Add the current number to the running total
  - After the loop, print the final total

  Try it out!

> i didnt ask the answer io asked to clarify 

● You're right, my apologies. Let me clarify Task 5 better without giving
  the full answer:

  Task 5 Clarification:

  You need to:
  1. Create an array with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  2. Use a for loop to go through each number in the array
  3. Keep a running total (start with 0, then keep adding numbers to it)
  4. After the loop finishes, print the total

  The hints given:
  - Use array.length to know how many elements are in the array
  - Use array[index] to access each element (like array[0] gets the first
  number)

  That's the task - you need to figure out how to add them together and
  print the result. Does that make sense now?

> check task 8 

● Let me read the file to check if there's a Task 8:

● Read(node.js\ex08_loops.js)
  ⎿  Read 46 lines

● There's no Task 8 in the file - Exercise 8 has 5 tasks (Tasks 1-5), and
  you've completed all of them! ✓

  Your Task 5 looks great:
  - You created an array with numbers
  - Loop goes through each element
  - t += arr[c] adds each number to the total
  - You're printing the progress as it goes

  All tasks in Exercise 8 are done. Do you want me to create Exercise 9?

> check task 5 

● Let me check Task 5 more carefully:

● Read(node.js\ex08_loops.js)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines

● I see an issue - the closing brace is missing on line 46. Your for loop
  isn't closed properly.

  Add a closing brace } at the end:

  let arr=[13,34245,453,74,885]
  let t=0;
  for (let c=0;c<arr.length;c++)
  {
      t+=arr[c]
      console.log(`Current index ${c+1} Current arr compoment ${arr[c]} 
  current summary ${t}`)
  }  // ← Add this closing brace

  That should fix it!

> it runs why u say its a problem? 

● You're right - if it runs without errors, then it works! I apologize for
  the confusion. I was looking at the truncated file output and assumed the
  brace was missing, but if it's running successfully, the code is fine.

  Your Task 5 is working correctly then. All 5 tasks in Exercise 8 are
  complete! ✓

  Ready to move on to Exercise 9?

> yes 

● Let me create Exercise 9 for you:

● Write(node.js\ex09_conditionals.js)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to node.js\ex09_conditionals.js                         
     // Exercise 9: Conditionals (if/else if/else)
     // Task 1: Create a function that checks if a number is positive, 
     negative, or zero
     // Function name: checkNumber
     // Parameter: num (a number)
     // Return: "positive" if num > 0, "negative" if num < 0, "zero" if num 
     === 0
     // TODO: Write your code here
     // Task 2: Create a function that grades a student based on their score
     // Function name: gradeStudent



● Done! I've created Exercise 9: Conditionals with 5 tasks:

  1. checkNumber - Determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero
  2. gradeStudent - Grade based on score (A, B, C, D, F)
  3. canVote - Check if age is 18 or older
  4. dayType - Identify weekday vs weekend
  5. findMax - Find the largest of three numbers

  These will help you practice if/else if/else statements. Ready to start?

> check ex09 

● Let me read the file to check your work:

● Read(node.js\ex09_conditionals.js)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines

● Excellent! Exercise 9 is complete and all tasks are correct! ✓

  - Task 1 (checkNumber) - Works correctly with positive, negative, and zero
   checks
  - Task 2 (gradeStudent) - Correct grading logic (A, B, C, D, F)
  - Task 3 (canVote) - Simple true/false check for age >= 18
  - Task 4 (dayType) - Correctly identifies weekdays vs weekend using || (OR
   operator)
  - Task 5 (findMax) - Correctly finds the largest of three numbers using &&
   (AND operator)

  All the logic is solid, and you're using conditionals well. Ready for
  Exercise 10?

> yes 

● Let me create Exercise 10 for you:

● Write(node.js\ex10_arrays_methods.js)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to node.js\ex10_arrays_methods.js                
     // Exercise 10: Array Methods
     // Task 1: Use map() to double each number in an array
     // Create an array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     // Use map() to create a new array where each number is doubled
     // Print the result
     // TODO: Write your code here
     // Task 2: Use filter() to get only even numbers
     // Create an array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

● Done! I've created Exercise 10: Array Methods with 5 tasks:

  1. map() - Double each number in an array
  2. filter() - Get only even numbers
  3. reduce() - Sum all numbers in an array
  4. find() - Find the first number greater than 5
  5. some() and every() - Check conditions on arrays

  These are powerful built-in array methods in JavaScript. Ready to work
  through them?
