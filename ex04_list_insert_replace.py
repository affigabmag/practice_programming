# • Exercise 4 – Lists
#   1. Create a list called nums with at least five integers.                                       
#   2. Replace the third element (index 2) with a new value of your choice.                         
#   3. Insert another number at index 2 (so it becomes the new third element).                      
#   4. Print the final list to show both changes.  

nums=[12,343,23,4675,55]
print(nums)
nums[2]=15554
print(nums)

nums.insert(2,2025)
print(nums)
